/********************* Answer for Exam 1 Question 2 ****************
********************************************************************

2a. Command: mkdir my-projects

2b. This is bacause I set the file permission of robot-moves.c with
chmod command such that the user's group and everyone else can only
read and execute the file (5 = 4 + 1) but not write or modify the
file. Only I, the user, can have access to all three permissions: 
reading, writing/modifying (including copying) and execution. 

To resolve this particular difficulty, I could use the chmod command
again to set the permission for the user's group at 7 (all three 
permissions granted). The corresponding Linux command is as follows:

cd
cd my-projects
chmod 775 robot-moves.c

In this way, the user's group, which includes my lab partner, would
be able to copy the file as she/he wants.
